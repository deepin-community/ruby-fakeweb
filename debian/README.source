This package uses the Debian 3.0 (quilt) source package format.

The upstream tarball has been repacked to remove the bundled libraries 
right_http_connection and samuel from test/vendor/, as well as
test/fixtures/google_response_* containing minified javascript code from Google
homepage.

The repacking is achieved with the debian/repack.sh script.
